About tapshex
=============

**tapshex** is a package and command-line utility for reading and interpreting CSV Files formatted according to the :doc:`DCTAP Model <dctap:model/index>` and expressing them as schemas in the `Shape Expressions language (ShEx) <https://shexspec.github.io/primer/>`_. This package builds on classes and functions defined in a related package, `dctap <https://github.com/dcmi/dctap-python>`_, and extends them with features that are explicitly aligned with ShEx. The command-line tool provided by **tapshex** is very similar to the :doc:`dctap <dctap:cli/index>` tool provided by a related package, `dctap-python <https://github.com/dcmi/dctap-python>`_.

The **tapshex** documentation extensively links to, and builds on, the `documentation for dctap <https://dctap-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ where interested users will find a general description of the :doc:`DCTAP Model <dctap:model/index>` and a :doc:`DCTAP Glossary <dctap:glossary/index>`. The **tapshex** documentation features, in addition, a :doc:`ShEx Glossary <glossary/index>`.

This package is under development at `https://github.com/tombaker/tapshex <https://github.com/tombaker/tapshex>`_, where issues or questions can be posted in its `issue tracker <https://github.com/tombaker/tapshex/issues>`_.
